> How many subgraphs of $k_n$ are isomorphic to $k_{3,3}$?

Pick three vertices from one side and three from the other:
${n\choose3}{n\choose3} + {n\choose3}{n\choose3}$

> How many subgraphs of $k_{n,n}$ are isomorphic to $k_{3,5}$?

Pick 3 vertices from one side and 5 vertices from the other.

$$
{n\choose3}{m\choose5}+{n\choose5}{m\choose3}
$$

> Let $k^-_n$ be a graph obtained from $k_n$ by deleting one edge. How many subgraphs of $k^-_n$ are isomorphic to $k^-_5$?

1. Choose $n$ vertices from $V(K_n)$ to induce $k_n$ 

$1\times{n\choose2}$
