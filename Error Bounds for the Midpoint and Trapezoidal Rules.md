The **error** is the amount to be added to make it exact.

From [[Trapezoidal Rule#Example 01|Example 1]], the error is
$$E_T \approx -0.002488$$ and
$$E_M\approx0.001239$$

The true intergal is is the **approximation + error**:
$$\begin{align}
E_T = \int_a^bf(x)\ dx - T_n\\
E_M = \int_a^bf(x)\ dx - M_n\\
\end{align}$$
