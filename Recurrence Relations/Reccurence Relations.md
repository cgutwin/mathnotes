How many binary strings are there of length $n$ with the property that every 1 is followed by a zero (so that 1 cannot be the last bit)?

>[!quote] Definition
>A **linear recurrence relation** (RR) of **order** *k* (with constant coefficients) for a sequence $a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots$ is an equation of the form
>$$
>c_0\cdot a_n + c_1\cdot a_{n-1}+\dots+c_k\cdot a_{n-k} = f(n)\text{ for }n\ge k
>$$
>where $c_0, c_1, \dots,c_k$ are constants and $c_0 \not= 0, c_k \not= 0$. If $f(n) = 0$ the RR is said to be **homogenous**, otherwise it is **non-homogenous**.

- The order of a RR is ==How many terms prior you're using==.
- For homogeneity, if you can rearrange the equation so that all terms on the right are zero, it is homogenous. Else, its non.

## Initial Values (IV)

- To fix the values of a RR of order k, we need k consecutive initial values.
	- As long as we have k consecutive values, we can get the rest in the sequence.

### Example
$f_n = f_{n-1} + f_{n-2}$

using $f_1 = 1, f_2 = 1$ or $f_2 = 1, f_3 = 2$, the same sequence is generated.


##

### Example

The Fibonacci sequence $1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, \dots$ is generated by the **recurrence**
$$
f_{n+1} = f_n + f_{n-1} \text{ for } n \ge 2
$$
and initial values
$$
f_1 = 1, f_2 = 1
$$

$$\begin{align}
f_3 &= f_2+f_1\\
&= 1+1 = 2\\
\\
f_4 &= f_3+f_2\\
&= 2 + 1 = 3\\
&

\vdots

\end{align}$$

This is a **second order homogenous** RR.

### Example
Let $b_n$ be the number of binary strings of length $n$ bits

#### A New Way
To construct a binary string of length $n$ first, construct one of length $n-1$ bits.
- Good for generating more strings

![[recurrence_relations_binary_strings.png]]

There are $b_{n-1}$ choices to fill, and 2 choices for the extra bit.

Therefore, $b_n = 2\cdot b_{n-1}, n\ge2, b_1 = 2$

$$\begin{align}
b_1 &= 2\\
\\
b_2 &= 2\cdot b_1\\
&= 4\\
\\
b_3 &= 2\cdot b_2\\
&=8\\
\\
b_4 &= 2\cdot b_3\\
&=16\\
&\vdots
\end{align}$$

This is a **first order homogenous** RR. We only need to go back one term to generate the next one.

### Example

Let $k_n$ be the number of edges in $K_n$ the complete graph on $n$ vertices.
![[recurrence_relations_graph_vertices.png|center]]
$$\begin{align}
K_1 &\rightarrow k_1 = 0 &&\text{A graph with one vertice, has no edges}\\
K_2 &\rightarrow k_2 = 1\\
K_3 &\rightarrow k_3 = 3\\
K_4 &\rightarrow k_4 = 6 &&\text{A graph with one vertice, 6 edges}
\end{align}$$
Consider a graph of $K_{n-1}$. There are $k_{n-1}$ edges in $K_{n-1}$, and we add $n-1$ edges to get $K_n$
$$\begin{align}
k_n &= k_{n-1} + (n-1), \ n\ge2\\
k_1 &= 0 &&\text{Initial value}
\end{align}$$

Generate values of $k_n$:
$$\begin{align}
k_1 &= 0\\
k_2 &= k_1+(2-1) = 1\\
k_3 &= k_2 + (3-1) = 3\\
k_4 &= k_3 + (4-1) = 6\\
k_5 &= k_4 + (5-1) = 10\\
&\vdots
\end{align}$$
This is a **first order non-homogenous** RR, as rearranging the equation for f(n) does not equal zero.

## Question

>[!question] Example 4.5
>Let $S_n$ be the set of all binary strings of length $n$ with the property that every 1 is followed by a zero (so 1 cannot be the last bit).
>1. List $S_1, S_2, S_3$.
>2. Let $c_n = |S_n|$. Give a recurrence relation for $c_n$.

### 1
$$\begin{align}
&S_1 = \{0\}\quad S_2=\{00,10\}\quad S_3=\{000,010,100\}\\
&c_1 = 1,\ c_2=2,\ c_3=3

\end{align}$$
### 2
To find a recurrence relation, we need to find a relationship between $c_n$ and its immediate predecessors.

A string $S_n$ has the following:
$$\begin{align}
0u\text{ where }u\in S_{n-1},\text{ or}\\
10u\text{ where }u\in S_{n-2}
\end{align}$$
Therefore,
$$\begin{align}
S_n &= 0S_{n-1} \cup10S_{n-2}\\
|S_n| &= |S_{n-1}|+|S_{n-2}|\\
\\
c_n &= c_{n-1} + c_{n-2},\quad n\ge3\\
\text{where }c_1&=1, c_2=2, c_3=3
\end{align}$$
